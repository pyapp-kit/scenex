    The camera lives in, and is a child of, a scene graph.  It defines the view
    transformation for the scene, mapping it onto a 2D surface.

    Cameras have two different Transforms. Like all Nodes, it has a transform
    `transform`, describing how local 3D space is mapped to world 3D space. Its other
    transform, `projection`, describes how 2D normalized device coordinates
    {(x, y) | x in [-1, 1], y in [-1, 1]} map to a ray in local 3D space. The inner
    product of these matrices can convert a 2D canvas position to a 3D ray eminating
    from the camera node into the world.

    Following OpenGL convention, a scenex camera uses a right-handed coordinate system,
    where the positive z-axis points out of the screen, the positive x-axis points to
    the right, and the positive y-axis points up.
