    # Step 1 - Determine where the ray intersects the image plane

    # The image plane is defined by the normal vector n=(a, b, c) and an offset (d)
    # such that any point p=(x, y, z) on the plane satisfies np.dot(v, p) = d, or
    # ax + by + cz + -d = 0.

    # In this case, the normal vector n can be found by the cross product of u and v
    tformed = np.cross(u, v)
    normal = tformed / np.linalg.norm(tformed)
    # And we know that the origin of the image is on the plane. Using that point we can
    # find d...
    d = np.dot(normal, origin)
    # ... and with d we can find the depth t at which the ray would intersect the plane.
    #
    # Note that our ray is defined by (ray.origin + ray.direction * t).
    # This is just np.dot(normal, ray.origin + ray.direction * t) = d,
    # rearranged to solve for t.
    ray_normal_inner_product = np.dot(normal, ray.direction)
    if ray_normal_inner_product == 0:
        # Plane is parallel to the ray, so no intersection.
        return None
    t = (d - np.dot(normal, ray.origin)) / ray_normal_inner_product
    # With our value of t, we can find the intersection point:
    intersection = tuple(
        a + t * b for a, b in zip(ray.origin, ray.direction, strict=False)
    )

    # Step 2 - Determine whether the ray hits the image.

    # We need to determine whether the planar intersection is within the image
    # interval bounds. In other words, the intersection point should be within
    # [0, magnitude(u)] units away from the image origin along the u axis and
    # [0, magnitude(v)] units away from the image origin along the v axis.
    offset = intersection - origin

    # We use some fancy math derived from the link above to convert offset into...
    n = np.cross(u, v)
    w = n / np.dot(n, n)
    # ...the component of offset in direction of u...
    alpha = np.dot(w, np.cross(offset, v))
    # ...and the component of offset in direction of v
    beta = np.dot(w, np.cross(u, offset))

    # Our ray passes through the image if alpha and beta are within [0, 1]
    is_inside = alpha >= 0 and alpha <= 1 and beta >= 0 and beta <= 1

    # If the ray passes through node, return the depth of the intersection.
