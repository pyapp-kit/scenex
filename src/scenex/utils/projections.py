    TODO: Consider passing bounds (i.e. a tuple[float, float]) for each parameter.
    Unfortunately, though, this would effectively allow positional offsets for width and
    height.

    Parameters
    ----------
    width: float, optional
        The width of the camera rectangular prism. Default 1 (mirroring the side length
        of a unit cube).
    height: float, optional
        The height of the camera rectangular prism. Default 1 (mirroring the side length
        of a unit cube).
    depth: float, optional
        The depth of the camera rectangular prism. The near and far clipping planes of
        the resulting matrix become (-depth / 2) and (depth / 2) respectively. Default
        1, increase (to render things farther away) or decrease (to increase
        performance) as needed.

        TODO: Is this a good default? May want to consider some large number (1000?)
        instead
